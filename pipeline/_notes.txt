Tasks submitted to SLURM won't run after they are preempted and requeued (or if they are
cancelled manually and the same task is submitted again) because of pydra locks. 
Tasks can continue to run after lock files are removed in pydra cache

Which means:
- for tasks that take days to run, sub

--------------
Another reason why tasks might not be running is if a task is cancelled or requeued when
 freesurfer is running (aka. 'IsRunning' files are still there)

E.g. if this file exists when a task is preempted and requeued
/om2/scratch/Thu/nlo/abide/USM/derivatives/freesurfer/sub-0050432/scripts/IsRunning.rh

recon-all for right hemisphere will not finish running  
which means the *derivatives/freesurfer/scripts/recon-all-status-rh.log file will not have a "finished without error" in the end 

Last line of recon-all-status*.log file if something finished running
recon-all -s sub-0050432 finished without error at Tue Dec 22 16:33:45 EST 2020
